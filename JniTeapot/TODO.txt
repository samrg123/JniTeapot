- ArPlanes
- Render pipeline!! ... think about global binding points/uniforms?
- Support for GlContext to open files for shaders
- Port shadows from varun branch into master branch

- ARCore drop bad frames
- FPS cap
- Galaxy S9 ArCore Bug
- EGL lowp color bug.
- Constant time PCSS shadows 
- FIV shadows?
- Spherical harmonics lightprobes?
- Only update ArCamera EGL image when timestamp changes
- GlCamera -- want to be able to poll front and rear camera for images! 
- GlSkybox perspective

Low Priority:
	- Gradle language support extension without security variabilities
	- Auto find/configure Android SDK home path for "Launch android emulator" extension
	- Add more instructions on how to import 
	- Make better logcat extension for vscode - Simple CPP program that filters content and hands output to vscode
	- Add extension installer for existing vscode installs instead of including portable version 
	- Ask for camera permissions at first run
	- replace lodepng with libpng?
	- Get real linux sleep granularity for timers
	- Clean up GlContext::RenderCubemap
	
Medium Priority:
	- VsCode NDK debugging support
	- Make GlLight
	- Optimize ARCore rendering loop

High Priority:
	- Procedurally build cubemap texture with camera
