## Guidelines

Commit messages should accomplish the following:

* Provide a clear and concise explanation of the changes made
* Indicate progress or lack thereof towards a specific goal

As a rule of thumb, make sure to **commit every change that is made**. Commits should never include multiple changes.

Examples of bad commit messages

```
fixed some ui stuff
oops
added login page inputs, fixed up ui for sign up, changed css for inputs
```

Examples of good commit messages:

```
Added consistent spacing to the css
Fixed up an error that was causing unexpected form entry behavior in Sign Up
Changed the site-wide input style to match company Guidelines
```
